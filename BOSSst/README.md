Code to implement spatio-temporal abuandance estimation for seals in the eastern Bering Sea from 2012 and 2013 aerial surveys.


The scripts ./inst/run_TMB_2012.R and ./inst/run_TMB_2013.R run the highest ranked marginal AIC model for the two years.  The script can easily be modified to fix the day effect to zero.

TMB code for conducting analyses is in the ./src directory.
